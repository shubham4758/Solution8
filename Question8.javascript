8.// Solution


The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in the following order:

1. `console.log(1);` - This will be the first log to the console, and it will print "1".

2. `console.log(4);` - This will be the second log to the console, and it will print "4".

3. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);` - This will schedule the logging of "3" to the console, but since the delay is set to 0 milliseconds, it will be executed as soon as the event loop is free. However, it will still be logged after the previous synchronous logs, so "3" will be printed after "1" and "4".

4. `setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);` - This will schedule the logging of "2" to the console after a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). It will be the last log to the console.

So, the final order of logs will be:

1
4
3
2

The reason for this order is due to how the JavaScript event loop works. Synchronous code is executed first, and then any asynchronous code (like the callbacks passed to `setTimeout`) is put into the event queue. The event loop continuously checks the event queue and executes the callbacks in the order they were added. Since "3" has a minimal delay, it gets executed after the synchronous logs but before the delayed "2".
